# Sales Performance Analysis for Monitoring and Decision Support

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales performance data to support monitoring and business decision-making. The dashboard provides an overview of revenue trends, customer segmentation, product performance, and category contribution.

## Business Problem
Sales data is often available but not always structured in a way that enables stakeholders to quickly monitor performance and identify potential risks or opportunities.

## Objective
The objectives of this analysis are to:
- Monitor overall sales performance using key metrics
- Identify revenue concentration across products and categories
- Analyze customer type contribution to total revenue
- Provide insights that support data-driven decisions

## Dataset
- Source: Synthetic beverage sales dataset
- Data includes sales transactions, product details, customer type, region, and time period
- Data is assumed to be clean and anonymized for analysis purposes

## Analysis Approach
1. Data validation and cleaning
2. KPI definition (Revenue, Orders, Quantity, Average Order Value)
3. Trend analysis by month
4. Segmentation analysis by customer type, category, product, and region

## Key Insights
- Monthly revenue remains relatively stable throughout the year without extreme fluctuations.
- Revenue is dominated by B2B customers, contributing more than 75% of total revenue.
- Alcoholic beverages contribute the majority of total revenue.
- Sales revenue is concentrated on a small number of top-performing products.

## Recommendations
- Monitor dependency on top products to reduce revenue concentration risk.
- Explore growth opportunities in the B2C segment to diversify revenue sources.
- Use the dashboard as a regular monitoring tool to identify performance changes early.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (data exploration)
- Power BI (data modeling and visualization)
